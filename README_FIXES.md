## Overview
All critical issues with wishlist functionality and admin product management have been identified and **FIXED**.

---

## 🎯 4 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 🔴 Bug #1: Wishlist Routes Conflict
- **Problem:** Route ordering caused `/bulk`, `/count`, `/check` endpoints to malfunction
- **Solution:** Reordered routes (specific before parameterized)
- **File:** `backend/src/routes/wishlist.js`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

### 🔴 Bug #2: API Service Access
- **Problem:** `request()` method was private, preventing wishlist operations
- **Solution:** Made method public
- **File:** `src/lib/mongodb.ts`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

### 🔴 Bug #3: Product Category Field
- **Problem:** Frontend sends `categoryId`, backend expects `category`
- **Solution:** Added field transformation in create & update endpoints
- **File:** `backend/src/routes/admin.js`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

### 🔴 Bug #4: Wishlist Data Structure
- **Problem:** Product data wasn't accessible in frontend components
- **Solution:** Transformed response to use `product` field
- **File:** `backend/src/controllers/wishlistController.js`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

## 🐛 If Something Still Isn't Working

1. **Check Backend Status:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   # Should see: {"success": true}
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   ```javascript
   // Open DevTools (F12) → Console
   // Look for error messages starting with ❌
   ```

3. **Clear Cache:**
   ```javascript
   // In console:
   localStorage.clear()
   location.reload()
   ```

4. **Check Database:**
   ```javascript
   // MongoDB should show:
   // - Products with 'category' field (not 'categoryId')
   // - Wishlist items with proper structure
   ```
