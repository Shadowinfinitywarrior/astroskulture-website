# Bug Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed critical issues with wishlist functionality and admin product management in the Astro project.

---

## 1. **Wishlist Route Order Issue** ✅
**File:** `backend/src/routes/wishlist.js`

**Problem:**
- Routes with parameters like `/:productId` were matching before specific routes like `/bulk` and `/check/:productId`
- This caused undefined behavior and routing conflicts

**Solution:**
- Reordered routes to place specific routes BEFORE parameterized routes
- Order now: `/count` → `/bulk` → `/check/:productId` → `/` → `/:productId`
- Added comments explaining route order importance

---

## 2. **API Service Method Visibility Issue** ✅
**File:** `src/lib/mongodb.ts`

**Problem:**
- The `request()` method was private (`private async request()`)
- `WishlistContext` was trying to call `apiService.request()` directly in the `clearWishlist()` function
- This caused a compilation/runtime error

**Solution:**
- Changed `request()` method from `private` to `public` (removed the `private` keyword)
- Now the method is accessible for internal API calls

---

## 3. **Admin Product Category Field Mismatch** ✅
**File:** `backend/src/routes/admin.js`

**Problem:**
- Frontend form sends `categoryId` field
- Backend Product model expects `category` field
- This caused product creation/update to fail silently

**Solution:**
- Added field transformation in both POST and PUT endpoints
- Converts `categoryId` → `category` before saving to database
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Rename categoryId to category for the model
if (req.body.categoryId && !req.body.category) {
  req.body.category = req.body.categoryId;
  delete req.body.categoryId;
}
```

---

## 4. **Wishlist Data Structure Mismatch** ✅
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/wishlistController.js`

**Problem:**
- Backend returns wishlist items with `productId` containing the populated product object
- Frontend expects the full product in `product` field
- WishlistPage component couldn't access product details (`item.product` was undefined)

**Solution:**
- Added data transformation in `getWishlist()` endpoint
- Transforms response to match frontend expectations:
  ```javascript
  {
    _id: "...",
    userId: "...",
    productId: "...",    // Product ID as string
    product: { ... },    // Full product object
    createdAt: "...",
    updatedAt: "..."
  }
  ```
- Applied same transformation to `addToWishlist()` endpoint for consistency

## Testing Recommendations

### For Wishlist:
1. Add product to wishlist → Verify product appears in wishlist
2. Remove product from wishlist → Verify product is removed
3. Clear entire wishlist → Verify all items are removed
4. Check product availability and stock status display

### For Admin Products:
1. Create new product → Verify slug is auto-generated
2. Select category from dropdown → Verify category is saved correctly
3. Edit product → Verify all fields including category are updated
4. Upload images → Verify images are saved and displayed
5. Set sizes and stock → Verify total stock is calculated
