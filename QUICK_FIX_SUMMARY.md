# Quick Fix Summary - Wishlist & Admin Products

## 4 Critical Bugs Fixed ✅

### 1️⃣ Wishlist Route Order (Backend)
- **File**: `backend/src/routes/wishlist.js`
- **Issue**: Routes like `/check/:productId` and `/bulk` weren't matching due to parameterized route ordering
- **Fix**: Reordered specific routes before parameterized ones
- **Impact**: Wishlist operations now work correctly

### 2️⃣ API Service Method Access (Frontend)
- **File**: `src/lib/mongodb.ts` 
- **Issue**: `request()` method was private, but WishlistContext tried to call it
- **Fix**: Removed `private` keyword to make method accessible
- **Impact**: `clearWishlist()` now works

### 3️⃣ Category Field Name Mismatch (Backend)
- **File**: `backend/src/routes/admin.js` (POST & PUT endpoints)
- **Issue**: Frontend sends `categoryId` but model expects `category`
- **Fix**: Added field transformation in both create and update endpoints
- **Impact**: Products now save with correct category reference

### 4️⃣ Wishlist Data Structure (Backend)
- **File**: `backend/src/controllers/wishlistController.js`
- **Issue**: Product data nested in `productId` field, but frontend expects `product` field
- **Fix**: Added response transformation to restructure data
- **Impact**: Wishlist items now display correctly with product info
